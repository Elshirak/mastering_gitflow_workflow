# mastering_gitflow_workflow
I'm going to create a Git repository with the commits shown in the commit graph below, this is the final project in [the course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/version-control-with-git). There will be no code, just having fun with git.

In this diagram, the ***long running*** branch labels have solid borders and the ***short lived*** branch labels have dashed borders. You can see that the
**master** and **developed** branches are the only long running branches. 


On the picture below you can see work process a little bit.

During the course I've practised new commands of Git: branch, log, merge, tag, rebase, pull and others. Here you can see the final graph of this task:
